I'm Andrew, a spatial data engineer based in Southern California.
Welcome to my personal blog, where I share intriguing projects I've been working on.

For over a decade, I've focused on building geospatial solutions.
My expertise spans various geospatial technologies, and I've honed my skills in Python,
orchestrated spatial data workflows, and implemented geospatial cloud solutions in Azure and AWS.
In a previous career, I worked on international development projects in
challenging environments, including Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri
Lanka, providing data management services.
I hold degrees in Computer Science, Psychology, and International Development.

Thanks for reading!
